This plugin allows one to insert WIMS classes in Moodle classes.
It requires a WIMS server to have been setup and correctly configured.
Information regarding extended configuration for the WIMS server required for this plugin to work can be found below:



------------------------
WIMS Configuration files
------------------------

A set of configuration files need to be setup on the wims server to enable connections from Moodle

The configuration files belong in the directory:
    .../wims/log/classes/.connections/

The files are called:
    moodle
    moodlehttps
    moodlejson
    moodlejsonhttps

In the template below one needs to specify a number of parameters by hand including:
    ident_site => which must include the ip address that the Moodle server connects from
    ident_password => which should be a real password and will need to be provided as a parameter to the moodle plugin


The files are identical except for the following differences:

moodle
------
ident_protocol=http
ident_type=wims

moodlehttps
-----------
ident_protocol=https
ident_type=wims

moodlejson
----------
ident_protocol=http
ident_type=json

moodlejsonhttps
---------------
ident_protocol=https
ident_type=json

# This is an example of identification file for connection to another

# If you copy this file to another one in the same directory, 
# and modify the definitions, you get another platform identification
# whose name is the name of that file.

# calling the same WIMS server.

# For security reasons, it is highly recommended that you only accept
# localhost connections. Accept several sites, but no wildcard.
